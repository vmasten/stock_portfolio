# Project Name
Flask

**Author**: Vince Masten
**Version**: 1.0.5

## Overview
An HTTP server built in Flask that allows user authentication and creation of portfolios of stock data from outbound API calls.

## Getting Started
1. Download the repo
1. Ensure your virtual environment matches that of the Pipfile
1. Start the server by entering "flask run" in the terminal.
1. Go to localhost:5000 for the homepage. Create a new user to see options for portfolio creation and stock search by symbol.

## Architecture
Uses Python, pipenv (with a variety of packages--see Pipfile for more information) and Flask as a framework for loading and rendering the pages.
